LIVINGROOM1
There is nothing of importance in your living room.

MUD_PUDDLE1a
You are standing in a puddle of sticky mud. East of you is the entrance of a cave, to the west a vast jungle, and to the north a pond. You vaguely remember jumping drunk into a time machine, vowing to steal the Mona Lisa from Da Vinci himself, but you seem to have gone a little too far back. Maybe just steal what ever you can, whenever you are... there is also a note in the mud.

You are in the mud puddle. East of you is the entrance of a cave, and to the west a vast jungle, and to the north a pond. You still feel that you might be able to steal the Mona Lisa, but you're not sure how...

#
JUNGLE1
You are in a large clearing, surrounded by tall trees. The trees tower above you, climbing them would be impossible on your own. There is a bone in the thick brush.

#
CANOPY1
You are high in the treetops. There is a peculiar leaf shaped like an elephant's ear. The only way you can go is down, but the drop is quite far... Also, there is something that looks like a TV remote?

POND1
You are knee deep in the shallow end of a pond. You can see the shadow of what seems to be a whistle in the murky water. South of you is that mud puddle. You can go deeper, but there doesn't seem to be a purpose to at this moment.

#
DEEP2
You are now deep in the pond. The ominous machine is now open to enter! You can swim back up.

VENICE
You are in the streets of Venice! How awesome! DaVinci's house is east! How convenient, but it may not be historically accurate.

#
BATHROOM1
Home sweet home! In the comfort of your own toilet! Amazing, but there isn't anything in here that you need! To the south of you is your bedroom.
#
BEDROOM1
Your bedroom! And woah! Another time machine! That must be how you went back in time. To the west is a hallway.
#
HALLWAY1
The hallway leads to the living room to the west. None of the other doors are unlocked? That's strange...
#
DYSTOPIA1
You are in some weird place, full of towering monochrome skyscrapers... not really what you expected.
#
DYSTOPIA2
You walk, but everything still looks the same. The city seems to span on forever...
#
BUTTERFLY
You are in the stomach of the butterfly. There is two chairs, one of which is occupied by a squat old man.
